The\n   code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the\n   symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the\n   symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order\n   for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n   are incremented backwards.\n\n   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.\n   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that\n   symbol does not occur in this code.\n\n   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,\n   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the\n   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted\n   table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by\n   the caller.\n\n   The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding\n   the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any\n   codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead\n   at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the\n   decoding tables.\n   */\n\n  /* accumulate lengths for codes (assumes lens[] all in 0..MAXBITS) */\n  for (len = 0; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    count[len] = 0;\n  }\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    count[lens[lens_index + sym]]++;\n  }\n\n  /* bound code lengths, force root to be within code lengths */\n  root = bits;\n  for (max = MAXBITS; max >= 1; max--) {\n    if (count[max] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root > max) {\n    root = max;\n  }\n  if (max === 0) {                     /* no symbols to code at all */\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;  //here.op = (var char)64;    /* invalid code marker */\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;   //here.bits = (var char)1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;   //here.val = (var short)0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n    opts.bits = 1;\n    return 0;     /* no symbols, but wait for decoding to report error */\n  }\n  for (min = 1; min < max; min++) {\n    if (count[min] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root < min) {\n    root = min;\n  }\n\n  /* check for an over-subscribed or incomplete set of lengths */\n  left = 1;\n  for (len = 1; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    left <<= 1;\n    left -= count[len];\n    if (left < 0) {\n      return -1;\n    }        /* over-subscribed */\n  }\n  if (left > 0 && (type === CODES || max !== 1)) {\n    return -1;                      /* incomplete set */\n  }\n\n  /* generate offsets into symbol table for each length for sorting */\n  offs[1] = 0;\n  for (len = 1; len < MAXBITS; len++) {\n    offs[len + 1] = offs[len] + count[len];\n  }\n\n  /* sort symbols by length, by symbol order within each length */\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    if (lens[lens_index + sym] !== 0) {\n      work[offs[lens[lens_index + sym]]++] = sym;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /*\n   Create and fill in decoding tables.

This is saved in low to check for when a\n   new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is\n   being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.\n\n   When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the\n   code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.

Code points are\n * integers in the range 0 to 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF). When serializing a string,\n * it must be encoded as a sequence of words. A word is typically 8, 16, or 32\n * bytes in size.

These encoding forms are described in the Unicode standard [1].\n * This function implements the UTF-8 encoding form.\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * In UTF-8, each code point is mapped to a sequence of 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes.\n * Note that the logic which defines this mapping is slightly convoluted, and\n * not as straightforward as the mapping logic for UTF-16 or UTF-32. The UTF-8\n * mapping logic is as follows [2]:\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+0000..U+007F, then view it as a 7-bit\n *   integer: 0bxxxxxxx. Map the code point to 1 byte with the first high order\n *   bit set to 0:\n *\n *       b1=0b0xxxxxxx\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+0080..U+07FF, then view it as an 11-bit\n *   integer: 0byyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 2 bytes with the first 5 bits\n *   of the code point stored in the first byte, and the last 6 bits stored in\n *   the second byte:\n *\n *       b1=0b110yyyyy    b2=0b10xxxxxx\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+0800..U+FFFF, then view it as a 16-bit\n *   integer, 0bzzzzyyyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 3 bytes with the first\n *   4 bits stored in the first byte, the next 6 bits stored in the second byte,\n *   and the last 6 bits in the third byte:\n *\n *       b1=0b1110zzzz    b2=0b10yyyyyy    b3=0b10xxxxxx\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+10000...U+10FFFF, then view it as a\n *   21-bit integer, 0bvvvzzzzzzyyyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 4 bytes with\n *   the first 3 bits stored in the first byte, the next 6 bits stored in the\n *   second byte, the next 6 bits stored in the third byte, and the last 6 bits\n *   stored in the fourth byte:\n *\n *       b1=0b11110xxx    b2=0b10zzzzzz    b3=0b10yyyyyy    b4=0b10xxxxxx\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * It is important to note, when iterating through the code points of a string\n * in JavaScript, that if a character is encoded as a surrogate pair it will\n * increase the string's length by 2 instead of 1 [4]. For example:\n *\n * ```\n * > 'a'.length\n * 1\n * > '💩'.length\n * 2\n * > '語'.length\n * 1\n * > 'a💩語'.length\n * 4\n * ```\n *\n * The results of the above example are explained by the fact that the\n * characters 'a' and '語' are not represented by surrogate pairs, but '💩' is.\n *\n * Because of this idiosyncrasy in JavaScript's string implementation and APIs,\n * we must \"jump\" an extra index after encoding a character as a surrogate\n * pair.

If p1\n   and p2 are the previous two bytes, we calcualte the context as\n\n     context = kContextLookup[p1] | kContextLookup[p2 + 256].\n\n   If the previous two bytes are ASCII characters (i.e. < 128), this will be\n   equivalent to\n\n     context = 4 * context1(p1) + context2(p2),\n\n   where context1 is based on the previous byte in the following way:\n\n     0  : non-ASCII control\n     1  : \\t, \\n, \\r\n     2  : space\n     3  : other punctuation\n     4  : \" '\n     5  : %\n     6  : ( < [ {\n     7  : ) > ] }\n     8  : , ; :\n     9  : .\n     10 : =\n     11 : number\n     12 : upper-case vowel\n     13 : upper-case consonant\n     14 : lower-case vowel\n     15 : lower-case consonant\n\n   and context2 is based on the second last byte:\n\n     0 : control, space\n     1 : punctuation\n     2 : upper-case letter, number\n     3 : lower-case letter\n\n   If the last byte is ASCII, and the second last byte is not (in a valid UTF8\n   stream it will be a continuation byte, value between 128 and 191), the\n   context is the same as if the second last byte was an ASCII control or space.\n\n   If the last byte is a UTF8 lead byte (value >= 192), then the next byte will\n   be a continuation byte and the context id is 2 or 3 depending on the LSB of\n   the last byte and to a lesser extent on the second last byte if it is ASCII.\n\n   If the last byte is a UTF8 continuation byte, the second last byte can be:\n     - continuation byte: the next byte is probably ASCII or lead byte (assuming\n       4-byte UTF8 characters are rare) and the context id is 0 or 1.\n     - lead byte (192 - 207): next byte is ASCII or lead byte, context is 0 or 1\n     - lead byte (208 - 255): next byte is continuation byte, context is 2 or 3\n\n   The possible value combinations of the previous two bytes, the range of\n   context ids and the type of the next byte is summarized in the table below:\n\n

context mode is calculated as:\n\n     context = (kContextLookup[512 + p1] << 3) | kContextLookup[512 + p2].\n\n   For any context modeling modes, the context ids can be calculated by |-ing\n   together two lookups from one table using context model dependent offsets:\n\n     context = kContextLookup[offset1 + p1] | kContextLookup[offset2 + p2].\n\n   where offset1 and offset2 are dependent
